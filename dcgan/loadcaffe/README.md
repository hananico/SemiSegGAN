loadcaffe
=========

Load Caffe networks in **Torch7** http://torch.ch

**Install torch first**. There is no Caffe dependency, only protobuf has to be installed. In Ubuntu do:

```
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

In OS X:

```
brew install protobuf
```

Then install the package itself:

```
luarocks install loadcaffe
```

In Ubuntu 16.04 you need to use gcc-5: ```CC=gcc-5 CXX=g++-5 luarocks install loadcaffe```

Load a network:

```lua
require 'loadcaffe'

model = loadcaffe.load('deploy.prototxt', 'bvlc_alexnet.caffemodel', 'ccn2')
```

Loading googlenet is supported by https://github.com/soumith/inception.torch
For other models with non-sequential structure check https://github.com/nhynes/caffegraph

NN support means both CPU and GPU backends.

You can also use Caffe inside Torch with this: https://github.com/szagoruyko/torch-caffe-binding However you can't use both loadcaffe and caffe in one torch session.

An example of using the package is in [examples/mnist_lenet.lua](examples/mnist_lenet.lua). After running script to train lenet model in Caffe you can easily load and test it in Torch7 on CPU and GPU (with 'cuda' as a first arguments)

Some of ImageNet networks are validated to give reported accuracy in torch in https://github.com/szagoruyko/imagenet-validation.torch
